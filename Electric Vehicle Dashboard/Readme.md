## Project Overview
This project analyzes global **Electric Vehicle (EV) sales** data to identify trends, regional adoption rates, and market performance. The goal is to provide insights into the growth of EVs, top-performing models, and factors influencing sales. <br><br>


## Objectives
- Analyze EV sales growth across different regions.  
- Identify top-selling EV brands & models based on sales volume.
- Understand regional adoption trends (e.g., Europe vs. Asia vs. North America).  
- Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.
- Find the best-selling products and categories while identifying underperforming ones.
- Detect sales fluctuations across different months, quarters, and years.<br><br>


## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of tableau and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems. I have worked with a small dataset and had used tableau to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.<br><br>


## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
 - **Dataset Link**: [EV Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mithilesh9/amazon-sales-data-analysis)<br><br>

Dataset contains total 17 columns namely :

- **VIN (1-10)** - Vehicle Identification Number of the vehicle mentioned in the dataset.
- **County** - Name from where the data is gathered.
- **City** - Cities Name from where the data is gathered.
- **State** - State Name from where the data is gathered.
- **Postal Code** - The postal code from where the data is Present.
- **Model Year** - Manufacturing year of the model mentioned in the data set.
- **Make** - Manufacturer of the vehicle.
- **Model** - Model Name of the mentioned vehicle.
- **Electric Vehicle Type** - Type of the vehicle present in the dataset.
- **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility** - Clean Alternative for the data present in this dataset.
