## Project Overview
This project analyzes Amazon's sales data to uncover insights into revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The goal is to provide a data-driven approach for understanding sales dynamics and making informed business decisions.  


## Objectives
- Understand overall sales trends, revenue patterns, and profitability.
- Learn how to use Tableau for data analysis visulization.
- Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.
- Find the best-selling products and categories while identifying underperforming ones.
- Detect sales fluctuations across different months, quarters, and years.


## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of Pandas and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems. I have worked with a small dataset and had used tableau to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.


## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
 - **Dataset Link**: [Amazon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mithilesh9/amazon-sales-data-analysis)<br><br>


## Dataset Columns
Dataset contains total 12 columns namely :

- **Region:**  The broad geographical region of the sale (e.g., "Europe", "Sub-Saharan Africa").
- **Country:** The specific country within the region where the sale occurred.
- **Item Type:** The category of the product sold (e.g., "Baby Food", "Office Supplies").
- **Sales Channel:** The method of sale, either "Online" or "Offline".
- **Order Priority:** The priority level assigned to the order (e.g., "H", "C", "L").
- **Order Date:** The date the order was placed.
- **Order ID:** A unique identifier for the order.
- **Ship Date:** The date the order was shipped.
- **Units Sold:** The quantity of the product sold.
- **Unit Price:** The selling price per unit of the product.
- **Unit Cost:** The cost price per unit of the product.
- **Total Revenue:** The total revenue generated from the sale (Units Sold * Unit Price).<br><br>
