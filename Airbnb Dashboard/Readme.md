## Project Overview
This project analyzes **Airbnb listings and bookings** to understand pricing trends, customer preferences, and location-based insights. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to optimize Airbnb hosting strategies and improve customer experience. <br><br>

## Objectives
- Analyze Airbnb number of bookings by months, quarters, and years.   
- Identify popular locations regions with high booking rates.  
- Analyze Airbnb number of bookings by customer type.
- Analyze Airbnb number of bookings and cancellations by owner.<br><br>


## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of Pandas and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems. I have worked with a small dataset and had used tableau to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.<br><br>


## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
 - **Dataset Link**: [Amazon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mithilesh9/amazon-sales-data-analysis)<br><br>
