## Project Overview
This project analyzes **road accidents data** to identify key factors contributing to accidents, high-risk locations, and trends over time. The goal is to provide insights that help in **improving road safety** and **reducing accident rates**.   <br><br>


## Objectives
- Analyze accident trends over different years and time periods.  
- Identify high-risk locations with the highest accident occurrences.  
- Determine major causes of road accidents (e.g., Road surface, Weather conditions, Road type).  
- Analyze accident severity (fatal, serious, minor).  
- Examine vehicle types involved in accidents (cars, bikes, trucks, etc.).   
- Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.<br><br>


## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of tableau and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems. I have worked with a small dataset and had used tableau to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.<br><br>


## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
 - **Dataset Link**: [Road Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nezukokamaado/road-accident-casualties-dataset)<br><br>


## Dataset Columns
Dataset contains total 14 columns namely :

- **Index** - Vehicle Identification Number of the vehicle mentioned in the dataset.
- **Accident severity** - Name from where the data is gathered.
- **Accident Rate** - Cities Name from where the data is gathered.
- **Latitude** - State Name from where the data is gathered.
- **Light Conditions** - The postal code from where the data is Present.
- **District Area** - Manufacturing year of the model mentioned in the data set.
- **Longitude** - Manufacturer of the vehicle.
- **Number of casualities** - Model Name of the mentioned vehicle.
- **Number Of Vehicles** - Type of the vehicle present in the dataset.
- **Road surface Conditions** - Clean Alternative for the data present in this dataset.
- **Road Type** - The range the car provides.
- **Urban or Rural area** - Base cost without any accessories.
- **Weather Conditions** - Legislative District it falls under.
- **Vehicle Type** - Department of Licensing issues Vehicle ID.


## Dashboard Features 

- **Accident Trend Analysis** – Yearly and monthly accident rates.  
- **Map of High-Risk Areas** – Locations with the most accidents.  
- **Causes of Accidents** – Breakdown of factors leading to crashes.   
- **Vehicle & Victim Analysis** – Types of vehicles and number of casualties.  
- **Severity Analysis** – Number of fatal, serious, and minor accidents.  <br><br>


## Tools Used  

- **Tableau** - Data visualization & dashboard creation
- **Excel / CSV** - Data source <br><br>


## How To Use  

1. **Download the Tableau workbook (`.twbx`)** from this repository  
2. **Open in Tableau Public**  
3. **Connect to the dataset (`Dataset.zip`)**  
4. **Explore the interactive dashboard**<br><br>

## Conclusion
This project provides an excellent opportunity for me as a beginners to gain tableau knowledge to solve practical data problems. By working through these, I gain hands-on experience with Visulization, graphs, date manipulation, and conditional logic.

- Enhancing road conditions, especially single carriageways, and implementing better drainage systems can reduce accident risks.
- Awareness campaigns focusing on vehicle-specific risks (motorcycles, tractors, etc.) and promoting safe driving in adverse weather conditions are essential.
- Implementing strict traffic laws (speed limits, helmet/seatbelt regulations) in high-risk areas can help lower casualties.
- Faster medical response in high-accident areas can minimize fatal casualties.
- Leveraging technology like AI-driven traffic cameras and real-time monitoring can help predict and prevent accidents.
